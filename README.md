# Machine Learning Projects

## Overview

This repository contains a collection of machine learning projects based on datasets from various datasets. The main objective is to analyze and visualize the data, explore patterns and correlations, and then proceed to the use of predictive models, analyzing them and identifying the best ones.

## Projects

### Pricing Boston House Analysis



### Iris Dataset Analysis

This project includes an analysis of the Iris flower dataset, focusing on the distribution of species and their morphological characteristics. Iris Setosa was found to be notably distinct from the other two species. Outlier detection and removal were also performed despite the dataset’s small size.
Three classification models—K-Nearest Neighbors, Support Vector Machine, and Decision Tree—were implemented to predict flower species. Model performance was assessed using accuracy, precision, recall, and confusion matrix. Among them, the Decision Tree model achieved the highest performance.
